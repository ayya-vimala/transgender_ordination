Transgenders and intersex people and at times other LGBTIQA+ have been excluded from ordination as a Buddhist monastic in the Theravāda tradition. This exclusion is the result of what I will show is an erroneous reading of several terms in the Theravāda Vinaya: *paṇḍaka* and *ubhatob­yañ­janaka*. Rendering the terms *paṇḍaka* and *ubhatob­yañ­janaka* into English, previous lexicographers of the Pali language have used vocabulary rooted in the Christian understanding of the early 20th century, like 'eunuch' and 'hermaphrodite'. It has previously been noted that it is problematic to transpose Christian modern terms in the understanding and translation of other religious movements. In dealing with the concepts of *paṇḍaka* and *ubhatob­yañ­janaka* the terms 'eunuch' and 'hermaphrodite' are inappropriate as they wrongly suggest that the lived understanding of sex, gender and sexuality in Ancient India is the same as it for us in the West today. The fact that certain groups of people are unable to obtain monastic ordination based on terms that are so little understood creates a barrier to all queer people who come to Buddhism seeking refuge from suffering.

When studying the Buddhist scriptures, especially where there are groups of people who are marginalized, it is important to understand where and under which circumstances these concepts and interpretations have originated. The Buddhist community evolved in constant negotiation with its wider religious environment and needs to be understood as a dialogue with its various 'religious others'. Claire Maes has clearly demonstrated that this process was central to the formation of the Vinaya as an ongoing dynamic to create a Buddhist identity notion. Many scholars have pointed out the many similarities between the principal ascetic practices, precepts and structures of Buddhists, Jains and Brahmanic communities and they seem to have had a detailed knowledge of each other's practices and organization. The interaction and debates with these 'religious others' led the Buddhist Sangha to implement specific rules in order to be in conformity with certain well-established ascetic customs on the one hand and to (re)define their identity as a clearly separate order on the other. In this paper I will argue that the concepts *paṇḍaka* and *ubhatob­yañ­janaka* have entered the Buddhist Vinaya after the Buddha passed away in the context of a much wider religious discussion that took place regarding the position of women within religious life. 

I will also show that these terms have their roots in Vedic mythology and provide a fresh insight into the Asian paradigms for gender identities. Here we find the living proof of evolving ideas on gender that are very different from our western concepts of trans-sexuality, intersex, etc. And here we find that these terms are intimately bound up with the deeply ambivalent attitude towards women and women's sexuality in ancient India.

In this paper I will first trace the emergence of these--and other gender-specific--terms in Vedic, Brahmanic and Jain scriptures and their changes over the centuries. I will then discuss the occurrences of these terms in the Pali and Chinese Vinayas and compare this with the understanding of the contemporary 'religious others' to come to an understanding of what the terms *paṇḍaka* and *ubhatob­yañ­janaka* really meant at the time these passages were written and the reasons why these are said to be barred from ordination. Finally I will show that neither these terms, nor any other regulations in the Vinaya, can be used as a justification to exclude candidates from ordination based on their sex, sexuality or gender.
