I dedicate this work to my Spiritual Advisor, Ven. Anandabodhi Bhikkhunī, who has helped me to understand my own spiritual journey as a queer female in a conservative and patriarchal Buddhist Sangha. I also thank my good friends Ayya Yeshe Chödrön and Ven. Akāliko Bhikkhu, who have always stood by me and encouraged me to do this research. I wish to extend my heartfelt gratitude to Ven. Ajahn Brahmali Bhikkhu for his practical input, translations and discussions and to Dr. Claire Maes, whose expertise proved an invaluable asset.
