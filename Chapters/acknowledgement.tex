\small I dedicate this work to my Spiritual Advisor, Ven. Anandabodhi Bhikkhunī, who has helped me to understand my own spiritual journey as a queer female in a conservative and patriarchal Buddhist {\em Saṅgha}. I also thank my good friends Ayya Yeshe Chödrön and Ven. Akāliko Bhikkhu, who have always stood by me, encouraged me to do this research and in fact are the impetus for it. I wish to extend my heartfelt gratitude to Ven. Ajahn Brahmali Bhikkhu for his practical input, translations, discussion and feedback as well as Brenna Artinger for her thorough research and feedback.
