\section{Introduction}


Just some notes to keep track of meanings and bits I don't know where to place yet.

\textbf{Vedic period: 8th-6th century BCE}: {\em napuṃsaka} impotent, effeminate or transvestite men. "not-a-male" i.e. men who did not conform to gender-role expectations. singers, dancers and prostitutes. {\em hijras}

\textbf{6th century BCE}: The adoptation of the word {\em napuṃsaka} as a gramatical third gender. "neither male nor female". previously mentioned "un-males" to be regarded as persons with ambiguous sex.

\textbf{after 6th century BCE/early Jain period}: new extra terms: {\em klība} (sexually defective man) and {\em paṇḍaka} ("impotent", "sterile"). Both associated with transvestism and dancing, {\em hijras}.

\textbf{0 CE}: ({\em tṛtīyāprakṛti}), lit "third sex" synonymous to {\em napuṃsaka}.


By the start of the common era, a term literally meaning "third sex" was introduced, possibly in the schools of traditional medicine, next to male and female ({\em tṛtīyāprakṛti}) and like the other two determined at conception by biological causes. \footnote{It is interesting to note that this third sex was seen as an equilibrium between male and female; it develops when the father's seed and the mother's blood are in equilibrium and the third sex also develops in the middle of the womb rather than on the right or left as with males or females. See footnote 16 in \cite{zwilling} for a detailed description.} In the 4th century CE the term had become synonymous to {\em napuṃsaka}.

In the fifth century CE the Jains used various terms like {\em tṛtīya} and {\em tṛairāśika} to refer to person of the third sex.
