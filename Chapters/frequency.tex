\section{Appendix 2: Word Frequency}
\label{appendix2}

The following charts show how often some of the words are used in the Pali canon as well as in the Sanskrit texts. Note that the size of the specific parts of the canon is not taken into account so we have to be careful drawing definate conclusions from these charts, but they do show the relative importance of these words.

It is important to note that unlike the texts in the Pali canon, the search over the Sanskrit text only use the GRETIL database and do not comprise of the entire Buddhist canon. The Vedic canon is also included in this chart.
