\subsection{Mahāsaṅghika Vinaya}
The Mahāsaṅghika Vinaya Bhikkhu Pakiṇṇaka describes that monks feel groping at night and after catching the culprit, a monk, he admits to being a 非男非女 i.e. neither male, nor female.\footnote{T22 1425 摩訶僧祇律 0417c14–0418a10.} They report this to the Buddha, who tells them there are six types of not males (不能男 者有六種) (lit. those we are not capable of producing seed/impotent\footnote{I will use the term `impotent' throughout this appendix but in most cases this is used as synomymous to `sterile'.}). The Buddha lays down a rule that none of these should be ordained and those already ordained should be expelled.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Those who are born impotent (生). 
\item Those who are born from a concubine (捺破).\footnote{This is the only place in the Canon where this is mentioned but X44 0744 0432c13 四分律名義標釋 0432c09–0433a01 mentions that there are 5 types of 黃門 (lit. yellow gate), which is translated as `eunuch' elsewhere and 6 types of 種不能男 (i.e. seed incapable men), the 6\textsuperscript{th} type being those born from a concubine.}
\item A castrated impotent man (割却), who is castrated as a punishment by the king's minister (割却 男根 lit. cut root/faculty of masculinity).
\item A transformed impotent man who is aroused by the touch of others but cannot ejaculate (因他).\footnote{This is a very free translation based on other texts where this type is mentioned.}
\item A jealous impotent man who is a voyeur and becomes aroused when watching others have sex (妬).
\item A `half-moon' impotent man (半月生者) (description of what this is exactly is unclear).
\end{enumerate}

The term 非男非女 (neither male nor female) is only used by the {\em paṇḍaka} to describe himself in this Vinaya. This could be a literal translation of the term {\em napuṃsaka} as in Vedic India this is an umbrella term, which includes the {\em paṇḍaka}. The {\em hijras} of India also refer to themselves with this term.

The term 二根 (i.e. 2 roots/faculties) is mentioned in passing as a question for Bhikkhu ordination but without further explanation.\footnote{T22 1425 摩訶僧祇律 0413c02.} Also the term 黃門 (translated as `eunuch'\footnote{In the remainder of this appendix I will use the translation `eunuch' (in quote-marks) as the official translation of 黃門 according to the dictionary. I will come back to this later as I refute this translation as too narrow and probably erroneous.}) is also mentioned here without further explanation.

Other words we find in the {\em Bhikkhunī} ordination procedure are those who have no breasts (無乳) or just one breast (一乳) or those who are barren/sterile (石女 lit. a woman made of stone). In this procedure it is mentioned that the candidate can proceed if she does not suffer from these conditions.\footnote{T22 1425 摩訶僧祇律 0472b05–0472b10.} We also find a question about whether or not she is of `two-paths’ (二道).\footnote{The term 二道 seems to be used as a synonym of 二根 (`two roots/faculties'). Another term used in {\em Pārājika} 2 T22 1425 摩訶僧祇律 0244a24 is 二形 (`two shapes'). There seems to be some confusion between three terms: 二根 (`two roots/faculties'), 二道 (`two paths') and 二形 (`two shapes') that are sometimes used as synonyms in different places. 二道 is at least in the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya mainly used to denote a person who has caused a schism. This is confusing because the word 道小 (`small path') in the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya is translated by \cite{bodhi} as meaning `underdeveloped female genitalia'.}

\subsection{Dharmaguptaka Vinaya}
In the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya {\em Pabbajja Khandhaka} the story is similar to that in the Theravāda Vinaya. A `eunuch' (黃門) is ordained and then tries to have sex with monks and novices but is rebuked. He ends up having sex with cowherds and shepherds. The story is brought to the Buddha who lays down the rule that all `eunuchs' have to be expelled and cannot ordain. He identifies five types of `eunuchs':\footnote{translation by \cite{bodhi}. T22 1428 四分律 0812b23–0812c10.} 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Those born as a `eunuch' (生黃門). 
\item A castrated `eunuch' (犍黃門).\footnote{lit. a bullock-`eunuch'.}
\item A jealous `eunuch' (妬黃門), who is aroused at the sight of others having sex.
\item A transformed `eunuch' (變黃門). Transformed means while committing a sexual act with another, he loses masculine function, and thereby becomes a {\em paṇḍaka}.
\item A `half-moon' `eunuch' (半月黃門), having male function for half a month, and being impotent for the other half of the month.\footnote{The word 不能男 (i.e. incapable/impotent) is used here just like in the Mahāsaṅghika and Sarvāstivāda Vinayas.}
\end{enumerate}

The regular list of persons not to be ordained is given, using the word 二形 (`two shapes'), translated by \cite{bodhi} as `hermaphrodite', while in other places in the Vinaya it uses 二根 (`two roots/faculties'). 

After this list the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya adds the story of a monk and nun respectively who change gender as mentioned in the Theravāda {\em Pārājika} 1. The Buddha concludes that they can simply go to the other Order and do not need to be expelled.\footnote{T22 1428 四分律 0813b15–0813b23. The commentary X55 0884: 表無表章栖翫記 0230c22–0231a09 explains that there is no need for re-ordination in this case.} Again, the word used here for gender characteristics is 形 (i.e. form or shape). The next paragraphs list the case of a monk and nun respectively who changed gender to become 男女二形 i.e. both male and female. The Buddha mentions that they have to be expelled.

The Dharmaguptaka Vinaya proceeds to list details of monks who have been castrated through various causes.\footnote{T22 1428 四分律 0813b25–0813c04.} Obviously these are not seen as falling under the same category as the above mentioned `eunuch'. Most of these, except for the one who self-castrates, can stay in robes. When castration happens through accident or even when it happens through karmic causes, the monk in question can remain, but if he causes the castration intentionally himself he is expelled. Here the phrase is 截其 男根 (lit. cut off the male root/faculty).

While in the Mahāsaṅghika Vinaya one who is castrated (i.e. with the cutting off of the male root/faculty 男根) is seen as an impotent man and thus not fit for ordination, here this only matters when the action is voluntary and not accidental.

In the {\em Bhikkhunī} ordination procedure we find the person with two faculties (二根) as well and in the same sequence we find the word 道小, which is translated by \cite{bodhi} as `underdeveloped genitalia'\footnote{T22 1428 四分律 0924c20.} but it literally means (`small path'). Unlike in the Theravāda Vinaya, this condition would lead to disqualification from ordination. Further down a separate clause is added for those who have no breasts (無乳) or just one breast (一乳), who are equally barred from ordination.\footnote{T22 1428 四分律 0926c20–0926c21.}


\subsection{Mahīśāsaka Vinaya}
The story in the Mahīśāsaka Vinaya {\em Pabbajjā Khandhaka}\footnote{T22 1421 彌沙塞部和醯五分律 0117c29–0118a05.} is similar to the Theravāda Vinaya. A `eunuch' (黃門) is ordained and proceeds to try and have sex with various monks, novices and others. As a result he is expelled together with others like him. Just like in the Theravāda Vinaya, there is no mention here of several types of {\em paṇḍakas}/`eunuchs'. At the end of the expulsion spoken by the Buddha, it is simply mentioned that the same holds true for those with `two roots/faculties' (二根) without further explanation of what this is.

The story of the monk who became a woman and was allowed to live with the nuns thereafter is also mentioned here and also the opposite case of a nun who became a man. The next paragraph is dedicated to a monk who, due to his great lust, self-castrated and as a result was expelled.\footnote{T22 1421 彌沙塞部和醯五分律 0119a11–0119a28. Unlike in the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya, the character for 根 (root or faculty) is used here for the monk/nun who changes gender while the word 形 (shape or form) is used for the monk who castrates himself.} 

In the {\em Bhikkhunī} ordination procedure we find another few terms in the questions asked during the ritual.\footnote{T22 1421 彌沙塞部和醯五分律 0187c21–0187c29.} It asks if a woman is barren/sterile (石女), it also asks if she is not an `eunuch' (黃門) and if the female genitals (root/faculty) are developed (女根具足). Here it is not specifically mentioned that somebody is barred from ordination if the answer is affirmative.

\subsection{Sarvāstivāda Vinaya}
The story in the Sarvāstivāda Vinaya {\em Pabbajjā Khandhaka}\footnote{T23 1435 0153b18–0153c17.} also tells of a monk who groped other monks at night which caused problems and started rumors. Again, the Buddha identifies five types of 種不能男 (impotent males). All of these are not allowed to ordain and are expelled if already ordained:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Those born impotent (生). (here possibly defined as a bastard)
\item A `half-moon' impotent man (半月), who is impotent for half of the month.
\item A jealous impotent man (妬), who likes to see others engage in sex.
\item An `essential'(?) impotent man (精), who causes others to have sex?
\item An ill impotent man who became impotent through illness (?) (病).
\end{enumerate}

In another part of the Vinaya this term 二根 (two roots/faculties) is used next to the term 黃門 (`eunuch') but not in relation to ordination. {\em Pārājika} 1 (just like the {\em Pārājika} 1 of all the schools) mentions the existence of 4 kinds of offenders, men, women, 黃門 (`eunuch') and 二根 (two roots/faculties). The same two words are used elsewhere in the Sarvāstivāda Vinaya while the word 種不能男 (impotent) is only used in the list for those who cannot ordain.

The {\em Bhikkhunī Khandhaka} goes more into detail about those who cannot ordain. The 二根 (two roots/faculties) is mentioned here.\footnote{T23 1435 0294a23–0294a28.} 

A similar list of questions is asked of female candidates for ordination as with the other schools. Amongst these are the question if the candidate has underdeveloped genitalia (女根小) (lit. small female root/faculty), has no breasts (無乳) or just one breast (一乳) and if she is sterile (是不能產). It seems however that regardless of the answer, the candidate is not barred from ordination.\footnote{T23 1435 0332b11–0332b22.}

With regards to the five types of 黃門, the Chinese commentarial texts merely add that these people cannot ordain because they have difficulty keeping the precepts.\footnote{T85 2792 毘尼心 0667b25–0667b26.}
