\section{Sex and Gender Non-Conformity in the Chinese Vinayas of the Different Schools}
\label{appendix1}

\subsection{Mahāsaṅghika Vinaya}
The Mahāsaṅghika Vinaya Bhikkhu Pakiṇṇaka describes that monks feel groping at night and after catching the culprit, a monk, he admits to being a 非男非女 i.e. `neither male, nor female'.\footnote{T22 1425 摩訶僧祇律 0417c14–0418a10.} They report this to the Buddha, who tells them there are six types of `not males' (不能男 者有六種)\footnote{摩訶僧祇律: 生不能男、捺破不能男、割卻不能男，因他起不能男、妬不能男、半月不能男} (lit. those we are not capable/impotent). The Buddha lays down a rule that none of these should be ordained and those already ordained should be expelled.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Those who are born impotent (生). 
\item Those who are born from a concubine (捺破).\footnote{This is the only place in the Canon where this is mentioned. Dr. Hsiao-Lan Hu remarks: 
\begin{quote}
``捺破者， 妻妾生兒， 共相妬嫉， 小時捺破， 是名捺破,'' seems to suggest that 捺破 is a condition caused by wives and concubines being so jealous of one another for bearing male heirs that they deliberately caused damage to another's son's genitalia (testicles, rather than penis, it seems) when he was young.  
\end{quote}
X44 0744 0432c13 四分律名義標釋 0432c09–0433a01 mentions that there are 5 types of 黃門 (lit. yellow gate), which is translated as `eunuch' elsewhere and 6 types of 不能男 (i.e. incapable men), the 6\textsuperscript{th} type being those born from a concubine.}
\item A castrated impotent man (割却), who is castrated as a punishment by the king's minister (割却 男根 lit. cut root/faculty of masculinity).
\item A transformed impotent man who is aroused by the touch of others but cannot ejaculate (因他).\footnote{This is a very free translation based on other texts where this type is mentioned.}
\item A jealous impotent man who is a voyeur and becomes aroused when watching others have sex (妬).
\item A `half-moon' impotent man (半月生者) (description of what this is exactly is unclear).
\end{enumerate}

The term 非男非女 (neither male nor female) is only used by the {\em paṇḍaka} to describe himself in this Vinaya. This could be a literal translation of the term {\em napuṃsaka} as in Vedic India this is an umbrella term, which includes the {\em paṇḍaka}. The {\em hijras} of India also refer to themselves with this term.

The term 二根 (i.e. 2 roots/faculties) is mentioned in passing as a question for Bhikkhu ordination but without further explanation.\footnote{T22 1425 摩訶僧祇律 0413c02.} Also the term 黃門 (translated as `eunuch'\footnote{In the remainder of this appendix I will use the translation `eunuch' (in quote-marks) as the official translation of 黃門 according to the dictionary. I will come back to this later as I refute this translation as too narrow and probably erroneous.}) is also mentioned here without further explanation.

Another term used in {\em Pārājika} 2\footnote{T22 1425 摩訶僧祇律 0244a24.} is 二形 (`two shapes'). There seems to be some confusion between two terms: 二根 (`two roots/faculties') and 二形 (`two shapes') that are sometimes used as synonyms in different places.

Other words we find in the {\em Bhikkhunī} ordination procedure are those who have no breasts (無乳) or just one breast (一乳) or those who has no vagina (石女).\footnote{Dr. Hsiao-Lan Hu translates 石女 as `having no vagina' but the dictionary entry in \href{http://www.buddhism-dict.net/cgi-bin/xpr-ddb.pl?q=石女}{www.buddhism-dict.net} translates it as `barren' or `sterile'.} In this procedure it is mentioned that the candidate can proceed if she does not suffer from these conditions.\footnote{T22 1425 摩訶僧祇律 0472b05–0472b10.} We also find a question about whether or not she has a rectovaginal fistula (二道通).\footnote{The commentary T24 1462 善見律毘婆沙 0763 explains: ``二道者，穀道水道''--``The two tracts are the solid tract and the liquid tract''}

\subsection{Dharmaguptaka Vinaya}
In the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya {\em Pabbajja Khandhaka} the story is similar to that in the Theravāda Vinaya. A `eunuch' (黃門) is ordained and then tries to have sex with monks and novices but is rebuked. He ends up having sex with cowherds and shepherds. The story is brought to the Buddha who lays down the rule that all `eunuchs' have to be expelled and cannot ordain. He identifies five types of `eunuchs':\footnote{translation by \cite{bodhi}. T22 1428 四分律 0812b23–0812c10.} 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Those born as a `eunuch' (生黃門). 
\item A castrated `eunuch' (犍黃門).\footnote{lit. a bullock-`eunuch'.}
\item A jealous `eunuch' (妬黃門), who is aroused at the sight of others having sex.
\item A transformed `eunuch' (變黃門). Transformed means while committing a sexual act with another, he loses masculine function, and thereby becomes a {\em paṇḍaka}.
\item A `half-moon' `eunuch' (半月黃門), having male function for half a month, and being impotent for the other half of the month.\footnote{The word 不能男 (i.e. incapable/impotent) is used here just like in the Mahāsaṅghika and Sarvāstivāda Vinayas.}
\end{enumerate}

The regular list of persons not to be ordained is given, using the word 二形 (`two shapes'), translated by \cite{bodhi} as `hermaphrodite', while in other places in the Vinaya it uses 二根 (`two roots/faculties'). 

After this list the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya adds the story of a monk and nun respectively who change gender as mentioned in the Theravāda {\em Pārājika} 1. The Buddha concludes that they can simply go to the other Order and do not need to be expelled.\footnote{T22 1428 四分律 0813b15–0813b23. The commentary X55 0884: 表無表章栖翫記 0230c22–0231a09 explains that there is no need for re-ordination in this case.} Again, the word used here for gender characteristics is 形 (i.e. form or shape). The next paragraphs list the case of a monk and nun respectively who changed gender to become 男女二形 i.e. both male and female. The Buddha mentions that they have to be expelled.

The Dharmaguptaka Vinaya proceeds to list details of monks who have been castrated through various causes.\footnote{T22 1428 四分律 0813b25–0813c04.} Obviously these are not seen as falling under the same category as the above mentioned `eunuch'. When castration happens through accident or even when it happens through karmic causes, the monk in question can remain, but if he causes the castration intentionally himself he is expelled. Here the phrase is 截其 男根 (lit. cut off the male root/faculty).

While in the Mahāsaṅghika Vinaya one who is castrated (i.e. with the cutting off of the male root/faculty 男根) is seen as an impotent man and thus not fit for ordination, here this only matters when the action is voluntary and not accidental.

In the {\em Bhikkhunī} ordination procedure we find the person with two faculties (二根) and the person with rectovaginal fistula (二道合). In the same sequence we find the word 道小, which is translated by \cite{bodhi} as `underdeveloped genitalia'\footnote{T22 1428 四分律 0924c20.}. Unlike in the Theravāda Vinaya, this condition would lead to disqualification from ordination.\footnote{The disqualification from ordination of the 二根 and 二道合 is confirmed in {\em Bhikkhunī Vibhaṅga, Pācittiya} 166–167, T22 1428 四分律 0773c21–0774b03.} Further down a separate clause is added for those who have no breasts (無乳) or just one breast (一乳), who are equally barred from ordination.\footnote{T22 1428 四分律 0926c20–0926c21.}

\subsection{Mahīśāsaka Vinaya}
The story in the Mahīśāsaka Vinaya {\em Pabbajjā Khandhaka}\footnote{T22 1421 彌沙塞部和醯五分律 0117c29–0118a05.} is similar to the Theravāda Vinaya. A `eunuch' (黃門) is ordained and proceeds to try and have sex with various monks, novices and others. As a result he is expelled together with others like him. Just like in the Theravāda Vinaya, there is no mention here of several types of {\em paṇḍakas}/`eunuchs'. At the end of the expulsion spoken by the Buddha, it is simply mentioned that the same holds true for those with `two roots/faculties' (二根) without further explanation of what this is.

The story of the monk who became a woman and was allowed to live with the nuns thereafter is also mentioned here and also the opposite case of a nun who became a man. The next paragraph is dedicated to a monk who, due to his great lust, self-castrated and as a result was expelled.\footnote{T22 1421 彌沙塞部和醯五分律 0119a11–0119a28. Unlike in the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya, the character for 根 (root or faculty) is used here for the monk/nun who changes gender while the word 形 (shape or form) is used for the monk who castrates himself.} 

In the {\em Bhikkhunī} ordination procedure we find another few terms in the questions asked during the ritual.\footnote{T22 1421 彌沙塞部和醯五分律 0187c21–0187c29.} It asks if a woman has no vagina (石女)\footnote{Translated elsewhere as `barren/sterile'}, it also asks if she is not an `eunuch' (黃門) and if the female genitals (root/faculty) are developed (女根具足). Here it is not specifically mentioned that somebody is barred from ordination if the answer is affirmative.

\subsection{Sarvāstivāda Vinaya}
The story in the Sarvāstivāda Vinaya {\em Pabbajjā Khandhaka}\footnote{T23 1435 0153b18–0153c17. 說一切有部《十誦律》：生不能男、半月不能男、妬不能男、精不能男、病不能男} also tells of a monk who groped other monks at night which caused problems and started rumors. Again, the Buddha identifies five types of 不能男 (impotent males). All of these are not allowed to ordain and are expelled if already ordained:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Those born impotent (生). (here possibly defined as a bastard)
\item A `half-moon' impotent man (半月), who is impotent for half of the month.
\item A jealous impotent man (妬), who likes to see others engage in sex.
\item A transformed impotent man who is aroused by the touch of others but cannot ejaculate (精).\footnote{``精不能男'' is described as ``因他人婬，身身分用，是精不能男.'' Dr. Hsiao-Lan Hu remarks: ``I think this is the equivalent of ``因他起不能男'' in the Mahāsaṅghika Vinaya. `精' refers to `semen'.''}
\item A castrated impotent man (病).\footnote{``若朽爛、若墮、若虫噉，是病不能男''--``if it is rotten, if it fell off, if it got bit off by wild animals (in classical Chinese, tiger is often referred to as `大虫').'' So 病不能男 is similar to `割卻不能男' in the Mahāsaṅghika Vinaya (except for self-castration) or `形殘黃門'.}
\end{enumerate}

In another part of the Vinaya this term 二根 (two roots/faculties) is used next to the term 黃門 (`eunuch') but not in relation to ordination. {\em Pārājika} 1 (just like the {\em Pārājika} 1 of all the schools) mentions the existence of 4 kinds of offenders, men, women, 黃門 (`eunuch') and 二根 (two roots/faculties). The same two words are used elsewhere in the Sarvāstivāda Vinaya while the word 不能男 (impotent) is only used in the list for those who cannot ordain.

The {\em Bhikkhunī Khandhaka} goes more into detail about those who cannot ordain. The 二根 (two roots/faculties) is mentioned here.\footnote{T23 1435 0294a23–0294a28.} 

A similar list of questions is asked of female candidates for ordination as with the other schools. Amongst these are the question if the candidate has underdeveloped genitalia (女根小) (lit. small female root/faculty), has no breasts (無乳) or just one breast (一乳) and if she is sterile (是不能產). It seems however that regardless of the answer, the candidate is not barred from ordination.\footnote{T23 1435 0332b11–0332b22.}

With regards to the five types of 黃門, the Chinese commentarial texts merely add that these people cannot ordain because they have difficulty keeping the precepts.\footnote{T85 2792 毘尼心 0667b25–0667b26.}
